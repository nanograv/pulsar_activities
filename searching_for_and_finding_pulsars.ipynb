    "In this activity you will work with real data, going through the steps to find and identify an otherwise unknown pulsar.  You will examine the radio frequency interference present during the observation, as well as the time and Fourier domain representations of the data.  Using programs from the PRESTO software suite, you will identify candidate pulsars, fold them, and ultimately find the real pulsar.  You will then extract a pulse time of arrival from the folded candidate."

    "Searching for pulsars is a computationally demanding and time consuming task.  You will be going through a simplified version of this process to illustrate the key steps, which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Identify and remove radio frequency interference (RFI).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Remove (partially) the effects of the interstellar medium (ISM) through the process of de-dispersion and create a time-series at a number of trial dispersion measures (DM).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Fourier transform the time-series.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Search for statistically significant signals in the Fourier-transformed data.  This may involve searching for pulsars that are accelerating due to their presence in a binary system.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Filter the candidate pulsars.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Fold the most promising candidates.\n",

Rather, it contains a low-density medium called the interstellar medium (when referring to the space between stars in galaxies), which is in part an ionized plasma.  As the radio waves emitted by pulsars travel through this ionized plasma, they move with a speed less than c, thus arriving at the Earth later than they would had they traveled through a true vacuum.  Furthermore, the amount that they slow down depends on the radio frequency, so that signals at a relatively high frequency travel faster than signals at a lower frequency.  This is known as dispersion, and the difference in travel time between radiation emitted at two different radio frequencies is known as the dispersion delay.\n",

When searching for pulsars, we use a technique known as incoherent dedispersion.  This involves breaking the radio signal down into discrete radio frequency channels of finite width, and then subtracting the appropriate dispersive delay from each channel, thus aligning all of the pulses.  This does not completely remove the effects of dispersion, however, because individual radio frequency channels have a finite width, and so still suffer a small dispersive delay between the top and bottom of the channel.

Unfortunately, we can only measure the DM of a pulsar after we discover it.  So how do we find new pulsars, for which the DM is not known ahead of time?  The only way to do so is to de-disperse our data at many trial DMs and search the data for new pulsars, hoping we get lucky.  A trial DM is unlikely to match exactly the true DM of a new pulsar, so there will almost always be additional smearing from using a non-ideal trial DM.  For this reason, the step size between trial DMs must be small, so that the DM error is not too large.  This requires using many trial DMs, each of which must be searched independently, and that requires lots of computing power.\n",

    "\n",
    "Searching for a pulsar with unknown period in the time domain is very difficult.  Unless the pulsar is bright enough that individual pulses can be clearly identified (and most pulsars aren’t that bright), we would need to fold the data at a wide range of trial periods and look for a pulsar-like signal.  That is computationally intensive and only starting to be done efficiently in blind searches.  Most pulsars are found using a tool that is designed exactly for identifying periodic signals in complex data: the Fourier transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entire college courses are taught on the Fourier transform.  Obviously, that is beyond the scope of this activity, so we will just touch on some of the basics.  The Fourier transform of a function $f(x)$ is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F(k) = \\int\\limits_{-\\inf}^{+\\inf}{f(x) e^{-2 \\pi i x k} dx} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $i$ is the imaginary number.  This is the definition of the Fourier transform for a continuous function, but in practice we work with discretely sampled data.  The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is then defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ X_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}{x_n e^{-2 \\pi i k n/N}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This may seem a little bit confusing, so it may make more sense if we take advantage of a pretty cool identity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ e^{ix} = \\cos{x} + i \\sin{x} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This let’s us write the DFT as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ X_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}{x_n \\left[ \\cos(2 \\pi k n/N) - i \\sin(2 \\pi k n/N) \\right]} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s describe this in words.  It turns out that any function can be described as a sum of many (potentially infinite) sine and cosine functions, each with different frequencies and amplitudes.  The DFT of a function tells us the contribution of these sine and cosine functions at each possible frequency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, suppose our data is noise free and contains a single cosine function with a frequency of exactly 2 Hz.  The DFT of this data would be zero at every frequency except 2 Hz, where we would see a spike in power.  The exception is at a frequency of 0 Hz.  Look at the above equation and see if you can figure out what the power would be at 0 Hz (Hint: this corresponds in the equation to $k = 0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pulsar signals are not usually well described by a single sine or cosine.  Instead, they are better described by a repeating Gaussian function (this is the classic bell curve).  But a repeating Gaussian can be described by (in principle) an infinite sum of sine and cosine functions with different frequencies.  In practice, however, not all of these sines and cosines contribute significantly to the final Gaussian.  If a Gaussian has a width $\\delta$, then it turns out that the number of sinusoids we need to adequately describe the function is proportional to $1/\\delta$.  Furthermore, if the Gaussian repeats with a frequency of $f$, then these additional sinusoidal components will have frequencies of $2f$, $3f$, $4f$, $\\dots$ . These higher frequency components are known as _harmonics_.\n",

    "In principle, to find a pulsar, we need to look for the Fourier frequencies with significant power, fold the original data at those frequencies, and then determine if the signal is a pulsar or RFI.  In practice, there are some subtleties to consider.  For example, pulsars have significant Fourier power at their harmonic frequencies.  If we sum the potential harmonics, we can find weaker pulsars, but this requires some care.  We also want to find _binary pulsars_ whose apparent periods are changing due to Doppler acceleration during the course of an observation.  This spreads power out among different Fourier frequencies.  We need to account for this to find binary pulsars.  Luckily, tools exist that take these and other issues into consideration to produce a list of candidate pulsars.  One such tool is called `accelsearch`.  We will use it now."

The option `-zmax` says to search only for signals with a Fourier acceleration ($z$) of 0.  In other words, we will not be searching for binary pulsars right now.

    "## Sifting and Folding\n",
    "\n",
    "We have only searched 10 DMs, but typically we search 10s of thousands!  That produces a lot of candidates, some of which may be duplicated at different DMs, of marginal significance, or known RFI.  So we typically use some intelligent sifting algorithm to reduce the number of candidates that are actually interesting enough to fold, though that number can still be in the hundreds for a single observation.  This is a complication you should be aware of, but that we will not get into now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Folding is a technique you have probably heard of before.  When we fold data, we divide it into segments that are each one rotation period long (for the purported rotation period of the candidate).  We then add these segments.  If there is a true periodic signal in the data, then whenever the signal is “on”, the correlated signal should increase linearly, but whenever the signal is “off”, the uncorrelated noise level should increase as the square root of the number of additions.  As such, we should see the ratio of signal and noise (not surprisingly called the signal-to-noise ratio, or SNR, or S/N) increase as $N/\\sqrt{N} = \\sqrt{N}$, and our signal should get stronger.  In this way we can see a pulsar whose individual pulses are actually lower than the noise level.\n",

    "In PRESTO, folding is accomplished using the command `prepfold`.  The most important thing we need to know when folding a candidate is the period.  There are many ways to specify this in prepfold, but the simplest is using the `-p` option."

    "# Advanced Topic (For those who finish early): Measuring a TOA\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to using pulsars to do great science lies in pulsar timing.  To do pulsar timing, we have to accurately measure a _pulse time of arrival_, or TOA.  This is the exact time (measured down to the nanosecond) when a pulse from a pulsar (or, to be more precise, when a particular reference point on the pulse from a pulsar) arrives at a telescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, it is easiest to measure a TOA in the time domain.  If you can detect an individual pulse, you could just record the precise moment that you see, say, the peak of a pulse.  There are a few reasons why you might not want to take this simplistic approach, though.  What we really want to measure is _how many rotations a pulsar goes through_, which means we want to define a point in the profile that corresponds to a particular point in the magnetosphere of the pulsar, which we assume is stable over the long-term and tracks a particular point on the surface of the neutron star.  As it turns out, individual pulses can arrive at any time within a pulse window, corresponding to what we observe as the _average pulse profile_.  If individual pulses can come from different points in the pulse window, then they will not correspond to a definite point in the magnetosphere, and so will not be useful for pulsar timing.  Luckily, the average of many individual pulses is observed to be _very_ stable for _most_ pulsars, so if we add many individual pulses together, we can be confident that a particular point (say, the peak) of the average profile does in fact correspond to a constant point in the magnetosphere, and hence the surface of the neutron star.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we will use an average profile.  We can do better still if we _cross-correlate_ this average profile with a standard profile that we think represents the ideal profile.  A cross-correlation will give us the offset between the observed and standard profile.  We can make a standard profile by fitting an analytic function to our data (a Gaussian curve, for example), or by using a very high S/N template made by summing many average profiles together, smoothed to get rid of noise in the data.  However you make it, cross-correlation between a standard and observed profile is the way to go.  But we can do even better if we perform this cross correlation in the Fourier domain (i.e., work with the Fourier transform of the observed and standard profiles).  The TOA precision that we can obtain using this Fourier cross-correlation technique is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma_{\\rm TOA} \\sim \\frac{\\delta}{\\mathrm{S/N}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\delta$ is the pulse width.  So bright, fast pulsars with narrow profiles give us the best TOA precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let’s do it.  First, we need to refold the pulsar you found at the very best period and DM.  Use the following command to explore the “bestprof” file that was created for your earlier fold.  This contains the best measurement of the parameters for this pulsar:"
