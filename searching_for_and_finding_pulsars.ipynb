    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity you will work with real data, going through the steps to find and identify an otherwise unknown pulsar.  You will examine the radio frequency interference present during the observation, as well as the time and Fourier domain representations of the data.  Using programs from the PRESTO software suite, you will identify candidate pulsars, fold them, and ultimately find the real pulsar.  You will then extract a pulse time of arrival from the folded candidate."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching for pulsars is a computationally demanding and time consuming task.  You will be going through a simplified version of this process to illustrate the key steps, which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Identify and remove radio frequency interference (RFI).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Remove (partially) the effects of the interstellar medium (ISM) through the process of de-dispersion and create a time-series at a number of trial dispersion measures (DM).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Fourier transform the time-series.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Search for statistically significant signals in the Fourier-transformed data.  This may involve searching for pulsars that are accelerating due to their presence in a binary system.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Filter the candidate pulsars.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Fold the most promising candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Inspect the results and decide which candidates are worthy of follow-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be using some pre-existing software to gain a better understanding of each step.  The data you will analyze comes from the Green Bank North Celestial Cap pulsar survey and is known to contain a pulsar.  Once you have successfully identified the pulsar you will extract a pulse time of arrival from the observation.\n",

    "## Dealing with RFI\n",
    "\n",
    "RFI is to radio astronomers what light pollution is to optical astronomers.  To mitigate RFI, radio observatories are typically built in relatively remote locations and have, at the very least, on-site control of radio emitting electronics.  However, all sorts of electronics emit radio waves, so completely eliminating RFI is not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various software tools and advanced techniques have been developed to mitigate the effects of RFI in data.  You will explore an RFI mask made using the program rfifind.  Because rfifind takes a long time to run, you will simply be inspecting one of the output files: a graphic representation of the RFI mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mask is made by executing the following command (all one line):\n",
    "\n",
    "rfifind -o guppi_55366_GBNCC16246_0087_0001 -time 2.0 guppi_55366_GBNCC16246_0087_0001.fits\n",
    "\n",
    "The -o option specifies the base of the output file name, the -time options specifies the time-domain block size (more on this during the discussion) and the last argument is the name of the file we want to analyze."

Circle or otherwise highlight these terms, and use the space below to take some notes.  Don’t worry if a lot of this looks confusing!

    "## Dispersion and De-dispersion\n",
    "\n",
    "Radio waves, like all electromagnetic radiation, travel at the speed of light, c, in a vacuum.  But space is not a vacuum.  Rather, it contains a low-density medium called the interstellar medium (when referring to the space between stars in galaxies), which is in part an ionized plasma.  As the radio waves emitted by pulsars travel through this ionized plasma, they move with a speed less than c, thus arriving at the Earth later than they would had they traveled through a true vacuum.  Furthermore, the amount that they slow down depends on the radio frequency, so that signals at a relatively high frequency travel faster than signals at a lower frequency.  This is known as dispersion, and the difference in travel time between radiation emitted at two different radio frequencies is known as the dispersion delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for calculating the dispersion delay between two frequencies is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta t = \\frac{e^2}{2 \\pi m_{\\rm e} c} \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{f_1^2} - \\frac{1}{f_2^2} \\right) \\times \\mathrm{DM}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $e$ is the electron charge, $m_{\\rm e}$ is the electron mass, $f_1$ and $f_2$ are the lower and higher radio frequencies, and DM is the dispersion measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dispersion measure is a combination of the number density of electrons encountered by the radio signal and the distance traveled.  Expressed mathematically it is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathrm{DM} = \\int\\limits_0^d{n_{\\rm e} dl} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n_{\\rm e}$ is the electron number density, $d$ is the distance to the source of the radio waves, and the integral is taken over the path between the source and the observer, $l$ (you may recognize this as a line integral, and the DM as a column density).  The units for DM are parsecs (an astronomical unit of distance) per cubic centimeter, or $\\mathrm{pc\\; cm^{-3}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we plug in values for all the physical constants, and assume that $f_1$ and $f_2$ are in units of MHz and that DM is in units of $\\mathrm{pc\\; cm^{-3}}$, then the dispersion delay equation simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta t = 4.15 \\times 10^6\\; \\mathrm{ms} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{f_1^2} - \\frac{1}{f_2^2} \\right) \\times \\mathrm{DM} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does all this matter?  Suppose a pulsar emits a broadband signal, meaning that the signal is emitted at a range of radio frequencies.  The high frequency components of this pulse will arrive at the Earth before the low frequency components.  What will this do to the pulsar signal?  In the next section we will find out."

When searching for pulsars, we use a technique known as incoherent dedispersion.  This involves breaking the radio signal down into discrete radio frequency channels of finite width, and then subtracting the appropriate dispersive delay from each channel, thus aligning all of the pulses.  This does not completely remove the effects of dispersion, however, because individual radio frequency channels have a finite width, and so still suffer a small dispersive delay between the top and bottom of the channel.

Unfortunately, we can only measure the DM of a pulsar after we discover it.  So how do we find new pulsars, for which the DM is not known ahead of time?  The only way to do so is to de-disperse our data at many trial DMs and search the data for new pulsars, hoping we get lucky.  A trial DM is unlikely to match exactly the true DM of a new pulsar, so there will almost always be additional smearing from using a non-ideal trial DM.

In practice, however, not all of these sines and cosines contribute significantly to the final Gaussian.  If a Gaussian has a width $\\delta$, then it turns out that the number of sinusoids we need to adequately describe the function is proportional to $1/\\delta$.

As such, we should see the ratio of signal and noise (not surprisingly called the signal-to-noise ratio, or SNR, or S/N) increase as $N/\\sqrt{N} = \\sqrt{N}$, and our signal should get stronger.

    "\n",
    "The key to using pulsars to do great science lies in pulsar timing.  To do pulsar timing, we have to accurately measure a _pulse time of arrival_, or TOA.  This is the exact time (measured down to the nanosecond) when a pulse from a pulsar (or, to be more precise, when a particular reference point on the pulse from a pulsar) arrives at a telescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, it is easiest to measure a TOA in the time domain.  If you can detect an individual pulse, you could just record the precise moment that you see, say, the peak of a pulse.  There are a few reasons why you might not want to take this simplistic approach, though.  What we really want to measure is _how many rotations a pulsar goes through_, which means we want to define a point in the profile that corresponds to a particular point in the magnetosphere of the pulsar, which we assume is stable over the long-term and tracks a particular point on the surface of the neutron star.  As it turns out, individual pulses can arrive at any time within a pulse window, corresponding to what we observe as the _average pulse profile_.  If individual pulses can come from different points in the pulse window, then they will not correspond to a definite point in the magnetosphere, and so will not be useful for pulsar timing.  Luckily, the average of many individual pulses is observed to be _very_ stable for _most_ pulsars, so if we add many individual pulses together, we can be confident that a particular point (say, the peak) of the average profile does in fact correspond to a constant point in the magnetosphere, and hence the surface of the neutron star.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we will use an average profile.  We can do better still if we _cross-correlate_ this average profile with a standard profile that we think represents the ideal profile.  A cross-correlation will give us the offset between the observed and standard profile.  We can make a standard profile by fitting an analytic function to our data (a Gaussian curve, for example), or by using a very high S/N template made by summing many average profiles together, smoothed to get rid of noise in the data.  However you make it, cross-correlation between a standard and observed profile is the way to go.  But we can do even better if we perform this cross correlation in the Fourier domain (i.e., work with the Fourier transform of the observed and standard profiles).  The TOA precision that we can obtain using this Fourier cross-correlation technique is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma_{\\rm TOA} \\sim \\frac{\\delta}{\\mathrm{S/N}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\delta$ is the pulse width.  So bright, fast pulsars with narrow profiles give us the best TOA precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let’s do it.  First, we need to refold the pulsar you found at the very best period and DM.  Use the following command to explore the “bestprof” file that was created for your earlier fold.  This contains the best measurement of the parameters for this pulsar:"
